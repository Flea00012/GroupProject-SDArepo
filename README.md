## Brief Summary

The platform is used by educators to support the learning process of their students with online education. The platform offers teachers features for creating assignments, courses, videos and also allows the teacher to track the Sentiment of the students. The platform offers the opportunity for students to pose questions to their fellow students and to the teachers. This communication is supported for persisted chat and for non-persisted chat (this is called the chatroom environment).
